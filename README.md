# Loan_Prediction_Python_Project
Predicting loan cases using Decision Tree

This project demonstrates my skills in data science and machine learning. In this project, I used Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to build a decision tree model for predicting loan cases.

The project involved performing critical data pre-processing tasks such as dealing with missing values, and outliers and encoding categorical variables. I also used data visualization techniques to perform data analysis and gain insights into the loan dataset.

One of the key highlights of this project was building a decision tree classifier using Sci-kit-learn. The decision tree algorithm is a powerful tool for predicting outcomes based on a set of input variables. By training the model on the loan dataset, I was able to predict whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not based on their information.

I am particularly excited about this project because it allowed me to expand my understanding of data pre-processing and machine learning algorithms. It also showcased my ability to use Python and various libraries to build effective and efficient models.
