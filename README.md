# Loan_Prediction_Python_Project
Predicting loan cases using Decision Tree

This task showcases my skills in; 

- Performing python skills for data science,
- Apply data pre-processing and transformation methods.
- Dealing with NULL values
- Dealing with extreme values and outliers
- Encoding
- Normalisation
- Performing data analysis.
- Developing a data mining and informatics solution for predicting loan

In this project, i used Pandas to read the dataset and performed data analysis and used matplotlib for data visualisation. 

This project further expands my understanding of data pre-processing, by implementing some of the key pre-processing steps. 

I used sklearn for data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The scikit-learn or sklearn is an open-source Machine Learning library available in Python for building effective and efficient models. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. I also used NumPy library, which is for numeric calculations. NumPy is n-dimensional array, and it is used for Numerical Python, including basic linear algebra functions, Fourier transforms, advanced random number capabilities.

In this project, i built a decision tree model to predict whether an applicant is eligible for the loan or not based on the given applicant's information. To achieve this, i first performed some data analysis and data pre-processing, which includes dealing with missing values and outliers values that appear in the dataset and i used sklearn to build decision tree classifier.

The Dataset was extracted from:
